## ***About me***
I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the **University of SÃ£o Paulo**. C, C++, PHP, Javascript, HTML, and SQL are the programming languages I'm better at. I like to learn and build great things I would like to use myself. I also want to make tools that can help people in any way.
